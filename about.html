          <h2> Artist Statement </h2>
          <p> Most of my work is done digitally whether it is through photography or various digital media. I have created various different pieces including 2D and 3D work, web design, various logos and posters and some paintings and drawings. I tend to use color in a way that elicits the natural world, my work is more conceptual color wise. I also really like my work to follow gestalt principals. The work uses figure ground relationships in a very direct way. I have found that I gravitate towards compositions that are closely related to nature or objects rather than figures. That being said one of my favorite things to draw or paint are eyes. They are an extremely interesting subject matter. Eyes are complicated organs that are often referred to as a window to the soul. </p>

          <h2> Bio </h2>
          <p> My name is Alex LoDico (b. 1996) and I am from Williamsville, NY, a suburb of Buffalo. I'm currently a senior at Clarkson University, majoring in Digital Arts & Sciences, with a minor in Communication. I am the House manager and Design chairman for the Gamma Mu Chapter of Theta Phi Alpha. I really enjoy Web Design as well as 2D illustration. I hope to go into the field of web design upon graduating in May of 2018. </p>
          <p> While at Clarkson I have taken an independent study in web design as well as served as the TA for the Front-End Development class. I have also helped with editing parts of Clarkson University’s Website and developed a complete redesign for a professor’s academic site. </p>
