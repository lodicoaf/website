				<h1> The Sports </h1>
				<p> If you know one thing about Buffalo it should be that it is home to some of the most dedicated sports fans there are.  The buffalonian sports fans are proud to be part of "One Buffalo", a slogan proving the connection of the sports teams in the city as well as their fans.  The term One Buffalo is also very apporopriate since the Peggula family owns three of the four teams located in Buffalo. </p>
